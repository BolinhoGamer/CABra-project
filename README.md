# CABRA-project 🐐
CABRA - Compilador Autêntico Brasileiro

The CABRA project is a Custom C compiler that generates MIPS assembly code

This is not my first C compiler, so I know most of what I'm doing

## Purpose
My goal is to make a full C compiler in Python, to compile C code to my MIPS emulator and, maybe, to Nintendo 64

## The generated assembly
The assembly code generated is MIPS assembly, used in my custom MIPS assembler, I don't know if it is compatible to other MIPS assemblers, but you can adjust the Generator if you want
